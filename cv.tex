\NewPart{Skills}{}

Teamworking: Playing in different bands for 7 years has taught me how to work with
different types of individuals with different skill sets. Playing effectively and as a team
required communication with the band in order to determine the direction of the music.
Written Communication: Both degrees have provided me with the ability to document
reports in a professional manner. I learnt how to document the requirements and design
of a system using techniques such as use case descriptions and the Unified Modelling
Language (UML).\\\\
Planning: Throughout my studies, there were times were strict planning was required in
order to meet tight deadlines. I learnt effective time management and planning to ensure
those deadlines were met.\\\\
Problem Solving: Working on various types of projects throughout my career has helped me develop the ability to analyse problems and come up with efficient solutions to those problems by writing efficient code Furthermore, I have gained experience in systematically debugging code by examining log files to find solutions to challenging bugs, including coming up with strategic ways to optimize the efficiency of existing code using programming languages such as C, Java and JavaScript.
